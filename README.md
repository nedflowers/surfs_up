# Surfs Up

## Overview of Project
Analyze temperature data for the months of June and December in the Hawaiian island of Oahu. Using the gathered temperature data, visualize temperature trends to determine if a surf and ice cream shop is a sustainable business venture year-round.

### Comparison
-	Temperature averages for both months only differ by about 4 degrees Fahrenheit. 
-	The minimum temperature in December is around 8 degrees lower than in June.
-	June has 183 more readings than December
    - June has a total of 1700 readings
    - December has a total of 1517 readings 


## Summary
Average temperatures in December and June only defer by around 4 degrees. Similarly, the maximum temperature in June (85F) is only 2 degrees higher than the maximum reading in December. Though the minimum temperature in December (56F) is 8 degrees lower, its temperature records above 70F during 50% of the readings. It's worth to note only 25% of December temperature readings fall below 70F. Overall, the temperature trends do not change drastically between June and December. One additional query to run could be helpful to pinpoint the exact time of day each reading was taken. If the minimum temperatures were recorded during late-night or early-morning, then the low temperatures may have a less significant impact on sales. Another beneficial query could be used to map-out the locations of each active weather station. This would be a good tool to compare and determine if a certain side of the island consistently has better ice-cream and surf conditions.
